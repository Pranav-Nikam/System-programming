Assignment-3 : Two-Pass Assembler - Pass 2 Implementation

Assignment Overview : 

This assignment implements Pass 2 of a two-pass assembler for a hypothetical machine. 

Pass 2 processes the intermediate code and symbol table generated from Assignment-1 to produce the final machine code. 

For the purpose of understanding, the final machine code is represented in decimal form, although it is usually converted into binary form.

Question :

Design suitable data structures and implement Pass-2 of a two-pass assembler for a hypothetical machine.

Consider the output of Assignment-1 (intermediate code file and symbol table) as input for this assignment.
