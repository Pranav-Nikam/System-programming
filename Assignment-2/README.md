Assignment-2
Two-Pass Assembler - Pass 1 Implementation

Assignment Overview :
This project implements Pass 1 of a two-pass assembler for a hypothetical machine. The focus of this implementation is to:
1.Generate the literal table, pool table, and intermediate code file.
2.Process sample assembly instructions from each category along with assembler directives.
3.Handle forward references and error detection.

Question : 
Design suitable data structures and implement Pass-1 of a two-pass assembler for a hypothetical machine.
Generate Literal table, Pool table, and Intermediate code file. Implementation should consider sample instructions from each category and a few assembler directives and error handling.
