Assignment-4 : Macro Definition Processing for Hypothetical Assembly Language Program (ALP).

Assignment Overview:

This assignment implements a macro processor for a hypothetical Assembly Language Program (ALP). 
This processor scans an input assembly file that contains macros, processes them by creating several tables 
such as the Macro Name Table (MNT), Macro Definition Table (MDT), and Parameter Tables (PNTAB, KPDTAB, etc.).

Question : 

Design suitable data structures and implement simple Macro definition
processing for the hypothetical ALP. Generate different Parameter Tables
and MDT, MNT. Detect any one error. Input file contains multiple macro definitions.

Output : Submit a single .doc / .pdf file containing input ALP, MNT, MDT, PNTAB , KPDTAB , EVNTAB , SSNTAB , SSTAB in that sequence.
