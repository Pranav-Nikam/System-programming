Assignment-1
Two-Pass Assembler - Pass 1 Implementation

Assignment Overview :

This assignment implements Pass 1 of a two-pass assembler for a hypothetical machine. The assembler is responsible for:
1.Processing assembly instructions, directives, and handling forward references.
2.Generating the symbol table and intermediate code file.
3.Detecting and reporting errors such as symbols used but not defined, invalid instructions, and invalid register usage.

Question : 

Design suitable data structures and implement Pass-1 of a two-pass assembler for a hypothetical machine.
Generate a symbol table and an intermediate code file. The implementation should consider the following:
1.Sample instructions from each category and a few assembler directives.
2.Forward references.
3.Error handling: symbols used but not defined, invalid instructions/registers, etc.
